# SocialMediaSentimentAnalysis
### Why?
#### Sentiment analysis on social media tells us how people feel. It can be about a product, about art or even about a business. As sentiment analysis involves analyzing sentiment/emotion in text data, it helps general consumers decide about a certain product or a business to find out the public opinion on their product. The insights gained from the analysis can be used in multiple ways. 

#### Personally, I meticulously research a lot about any expensive product that I buy, and it eats up a lot of time. Instead, I can just collect the text data about that product and just run it on this application and find out how people are thinking about it without going through thousands of reviews, which saves a lot of time.

### Dataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)
